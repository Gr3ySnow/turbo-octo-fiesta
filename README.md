Hello my name is Gr3ySnow, and  this is turbo-octo-fiesta.

TOF(turbo-octo-fiesta) will be an all in one computer system monitor
that will show and record allocated computer recources.
--------------------------------------------------------
This will be done using an integration of python as backend,
fastAPI and other tools/softwares not yet decided.

The main python libraies that will be in use as of now will be
"psutil", "psutil scapy pandas", and "time"
-------------------------------------------------------
TOF will be my starting and lifelong project that will start me on my 
journey as a software developer. Thers isn't much to say but other than
"Let us get to work".
